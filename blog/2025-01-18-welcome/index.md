Hi, I am Akhmad. In this blog, I share my learning experiences.

<!-- truncate -->

I am currently studying Computer Science at The College of Wooster (COW). I have experience working as a software engineer intern at both a startup [(**AtomRain Inc.**)](https://atomrain.com/) and a large corporation [(**Electronic Arts, EA**)](https://www.ea.com/).

During my sophomore year of college (2023–2024), I worked as a Research Assistant under Dr. Dan Palmer on Generative AI, focusing on enabling people without a STEM background to leverage it in their respective domains. Our research was successful, and our proof of concept was accepted, leading to the creation of a new Generative AI class at the COW. Our abstract submission was accepted to the National Conference on Undergraduate Research [(NCUR)](https://www.cur.org/events-services/ncur/), and we are excited to present it from April 7–9, 2025, in Pittsburgh, PA.

I also serve as the Founder and Lead of the Google Developer Student Club [(WooGDSC)](https://developers.google.com/community) on our campus. Inspired by the talent and dedication of my hardworking peers, I wanted to establish a club where, despite our diverse interests, we could come together to discuss technology and its impact on our lives. WooGDSC is the first organization of its kind at our college and is open to anyone interested in or eager to learn about technology. So far, we have organized various workshops, peer knowledge-sharing sessions, and career insight events.

My goal is to create technology that serves people. I aspire to build technology ventures across diverse sectors, including rockets and space exploration, AI, cancer research, robotics, and quantum computing.
