Hi, I am Akhmad. In this post, I share about my motivation for my research project. Rest assured, my content is not AI-generated, though it has been revised for grammar and vocabulary using ChatGPT.

It was the fall of 2024, and I had just started my junior year at The College of Wooster (COW). As soon as I got back to college from summer break, I was constantly searching for an idea for my senior Independent Study (IS)—a year-long research project at COW that allows seniors to dive deep research related to their major.

I wanted to work on something **challenging, ambitious, and fun** —a project that was entirely new to me. In short, I wanted to push myself beyond my limits.

In my Operating Systems class one day, we had a guest lecturer, Dr. Musgrave, present about the multi-threaded program he wrote to utilize the latest NVIDIA A-series GPUs that we had recently acquired. As he presented, he mentioned that there are lots of questions in this growing field, like what we mean by performance and "my code runs fast."

Later, I saw a news feed about "Meta is spending billions" on AI chips and I was intrigued by such strong demand. Given the expensive nature of this hardware, I was curious about how much of this resource is being optimally utilized and whether there is any room for improvement.

This is what I am set to explore in my senior independent research.
